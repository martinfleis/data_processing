# Computational platform

This project relies on the [`gds_env`](https://github.com/darribas/gds_env) as its main computational engine, which is deployed on a variety of servers and setups. This means that all the code produced in the project is reproducible under the containers provided in [`gds_env`](https://github.com/darribas/gds_env). 

For more information on how to run [`gds_env`](https://github.com/darribas/gds_env), please visit:
